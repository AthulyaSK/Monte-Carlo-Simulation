# Monte-Carlo-Simulation
#### Created a function net_profit with given set of inputs (cost and returns) that defines new features for a smart watch
#### Simulated net profit using various variables that defines the new features which should be added to the previous version of Smart watch to understand simaulated profitability of a negative profit
#### Ran a multiple linear regression analysis on the simulated data to see how the simulated input affects net profit
